# Horiseon-Webpage

The application provides information on a webpage for the company Horiseon.

To install this,  clone the code to your PC by using "Git Clone" followed by the HTTP url.

You are able to clich the links to move to the different sections and read the different information in the seperate sections.

I worked on this project alone.
